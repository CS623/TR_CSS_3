      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed Through some interesting
      places on the way: 
      <ol>
        <li>Walla Walla in Wa</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance , CO</li>
        <li>Why, AZ</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
      </ol>

      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the load today :
      <blockquote>Passing cars <br> When you can't see, May get you <br> Aglimpse <br> Of eternity.</blockquote>
       I definitely won't be Passing any cars.

      My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed
      and ready to go. Because I'm on a segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole
      lot with me: 
      <ul>
        <li>cell phone</li>
        <li>ipod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
      </ul>
      Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
      <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
